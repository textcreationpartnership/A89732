            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Both Swords make up a compleat Medium of all our good and remedy of all evil, and are of ſpeciall uſe each to other mutually, as well as of neceſſary uſe unto the people joyntly. The Magiſtrates need the Miniſtery to fix them in the Conſciences of men, and the Miniſters need the Magiſtracy to preſerve them from men that have no Conſcience, or worſe. <hi>Saul</hi> feels the worth of <hi>Samuels</hi> Countenance: <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſoon wants <hi>Jehojada,</hi> nor doth <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> forbear to honour <hi>Eliſha</hi> with the compellation of My Father, My Father.

               <p>The Queſtion between the Orthodox and the Dialogue is not whether the Mediatorly obedience of Chriſt be a meritorious price of redemption, but whether the Mediatorial obedience of Chriſt in the Dialogue be the Mediatorly obedience of Chriſt; So that hitherto you do but beg not ſtate the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or rather boaſt of a queſtion begged, then ſtate a Queſtion to be diſputed. That part of the Controverſie which concerns Mediatorly obedience ſhall be truly ſtated in its due place.</p>
               <p>It is very true that the Mediatorly obedience of Chriſt is the meritorious and full price of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but moſt untrue in the ſenſe of your Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial obedience for you leave out and reject from thence Chriſts obedience to the Law of works as God-man, his judiciall bearing of ſin, his ſuffering the puniſhment due for ſin, in way of ſatisfaction to divine juſtice,<note place="margin">Suſtinent quidem, ſed non ita ut uſquam ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaciant justitiae Dei <hi>Urſin.</hi> Ex. plic.

               <p>The triall of Chriſts Mediatorly obedience lay in the greatneſſe of thoſe ſufferings, which as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he was to undergo, and was ſo much greater in reſpect of God, then it was in reſpect of Satan and his inſtruments; as the ſufferings of the ſoul exceed the ſufferings of the body; the juſt charge of all the ſinnes of the elect, the unjuſt charges of men; and as the righteous wrath of God exceeded the unrighteous wrath of Satan and his agents.</p>

               <p>Touching the Reprobate there is no controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: Concerning the Elect thus, Either Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the poenall Death of the curſe due to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect for ſin, or the Elect ſuffer it themſelves, or the curſe is not executed; but the Elect ſuffer it not themſelves, neither is the curſe not executed; for then the truth of the Commination, and Divine juſtice ſhould fail. Therefore Chriſt ſuffered the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:121497:21"/>
poenall Death of the curſe due to the Elect for ſinne.</p>
               <p>Briefly, this Text <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. is Gods judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all denunciation of the puniſhment of ſinne, with a reſervation of his purpoſe concerning the execution of the execution of it. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is denounced to ſhew divine deteſtation of ſin, to deterre man from ſin, to leave man the more inexcuſable in ſin: his purpoſe concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution is reſerved, that the myſtery of the Goſpel might not be opened before its time. This for the clearing of the Text.</p>
               <p>Since you diſlike the laſt member of the disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction you do ill to approve the former, for thence it followeth, Either that God is not true, or elſe that <hi>Adam</hi> with his Elect poſterity muſt periſh: for they ſinned, yet by your expoſition neither die in themſelves nor in their ſurety, notwithſtanding the Divine Commination; and ſo either you take truth from God, or ſalvation from the elect (which alſo denieth the truth of God in the promiſe) in your very entrance.</p>

               <p>As the eternall vertue of Chriſts ſufferings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the eternity of ſuffering formally, ſo Chriſt in ſuffering the wrath of God formally, ſuffered virtually whatſoever was due to the Elect for their ſin, and ſo by ſuffering redeemed us from all the properly-poenall curſes of the Law whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

               <p>As concerning your ſecond Reaſon. The place of puniſhment is not of the eſſence of puniſhment. Malefactors may and oft do ſuffer out of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary place of execution. The devil alwaies ſuffers helliſh pains in ſome degree, yet is many times out of the place of hell. Souls in this life feel the wrath of God in ſome degree; 'tis not impoſſible then in reſpect of the thing it ſelf, but that it may be felt in its full degree. Chriſt felt the joys of heaven out of heaven in his transfiguration and after his Reſurrection; ſo he both might and did feel the pains of hell out of hell: There is a poenall hell and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121497:25"/>
a locall hell; a poenall hell may be where there is not a locall hell.</p>
               <p>'Tis from the free diſpenſation of God, not from the nature of the things themſelves, that the full meaſure of the wrath of God is not ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in this life.

So (if God pleaſe) may a perſon enter into the pains of hell without death: The Reprobate alive at the laſt day ſhall not die, and yet ſhall ſuffer the pains of eternall death.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction of the firſt and ſecond Death in reſpect of the order of the execution holds only concerning the Reprobate; Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the eſſentiall poenall wrath of God, which anſwers the ſuffering of the ſecond death due to the elect for their ſin, before he ſuffered his naturall death.</p>

               <p>Satan and men were Inſtrumens in inflicting ſuch a ſtroak, therefore it is no ſtroak of divine vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative juſtice, is no good conſequence: All evils inflicted upon the reprobate, whether corporall or ſpirituall, are ſtroaks or acts of vindicative juſtice: So often then as Satan or men are inſtrumentall in inflicting ſuch evils, ſo often Satan and men are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in ſtroaks of vindicative juſtice, judicial pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin with ſin is an act of vindicative wrath; but of this parents are inſtrumental in the propagation of original ſin to their Reprobate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

               <p>Put caſe you produce a type which holdeth not forth bearing of ſin by imputation in the Antitype; except it may appear, that the manner of Chriſts bearing ſin was thereby fully intended, you conclude nothing. <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Prieſt wearing the golden plate upon his forehead, having engraven therupon <hi>HOLINESSE TO THE LORD,</hi> typified rhe perfect holineſſe in Chriſt, by reaſon of the Divine nature, whereby he was able effectually to bear, and bear away ſin; What is here againſt Imputation? nay, it is implied in the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prieſts <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.17. by eating the peoples ſin-offering, declared by that act, together with the fore-mentioned appearing in their ſtead, confeſſing of their ſin, and offering ſacrifice for them; that by divine inſtitution they took upon them typically to make atonement for their ſin. Hereby it is more plainly figured that Chriſt ſhould bear away our ſin by bearing it in our ſtead. This Text maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.</p>
               <p>It is very true, God laid our ſins upon Chriſt as our ſacrifice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. therefore (ſay we) by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: for Chriſts ſacrifice is his voluntary and obedient yeelding himſelf unto death, according to the Covenant of God in a way of ſatisfaction to divine juſtice for ſin, and meritorious expiation of ſin. Hence in your ſaying he bare ſin, <hi>ergo</hi> not by imputation, you may ſee your ſelf intangled in a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121497:31"/>
contradiction, and the argument turning head di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt you. In but ſaying ſo and not proving it, you beg, but do not prove what you ſay,</p>
               <p>Synonima's are divers words ſignifying the ſame thing, but death, bearing ſinne, interceſſion, are doubtleſſe divers things, though they concurre as ingredients into the ſame whole of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

               <p>The Perſon that brought the ſacrifice was to put his hand (lay his hand ſaith <hi>Ainſworth</hi>) upon the head thereof, yet living. <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4. as confeſſing his guilt, and putting, or imputing it upon the Beaſt to be ſacrificed.

               <p>The Apoſtle then whileſt he is ſpeaking of the Antitype, chooſing out ſuch a word to expreſſe Chriſts bearing of ſin, teacheth us thereby that Chriſt did both carry up and bear the load of our ſins imputed to him upon the croſſe, and alſo bear them clear away: and thus <hi>Iſaiah, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſweetly agree together, and interpret one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as concerning Chriſts bearing the imputation of guilt and puniſhment of ſin.</p>

But this bloudy ſweat of Chriſt (properly ſo) flowing from ſuch a perſon, and free from all diſtemper, either of body or minde, and in ſuch a manner and plenty (as <hi>Luke</hi> reports) differed much from all theſe. Whether the ſweat of Chriſt were naturall or miraculous, we leave it to them that have leiſure and skill to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, though the Evangeliſt mentioneth it as an effect proceeding from a greater cauſe then the fear of a meet naturall death; all which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet is not our doctrine built only or chiefly upon this Argument.</p>

                  </label> The plain meaning of the Authour in this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is, Chriſt died as a Malefactor only (though unjuſtly) in the Jews account, but not as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: As a Mediatour only in Gods account, but not as a Malefactor.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction in name, but in truth a Sophiſm, is uſed as a crutch to ſupport the halting doctrine of the non-imputation of ſin unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſts death as a Mediatour (ſaith the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was not really finiſhed by thoſe torments which he ſuffered as a Malefactor: the Jews are ſaid to put Chriſt to death, becauſe they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put him to death, but did not ſeparate his ſoul from his body; in that ſenſe they did not put him to death, ſo is the diſtinction expreſly interpreted, <hi>pag.</hi> 100.</p>
               <p>If Chriſts death was a ſuffering then the formall cauſe thereof was not that active ſeparation of his ſoul from his body, ſo often mentioned by the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, otherwiſe Chriſt ſhould have been his own afflicter, yea, and in this caſe his own Executioner, which laſt the Dialogue it ſelf expreſly rejecteth. But the Dialogue reſuming and inſiſting further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this diſtinction elſewhere, let the fuller ſpeaking thereunto be referred till then.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Haman</hi> according to the true ſenſe of that Text, <hi>Eſt</hi> 8.7. be ſaid to lay his hand upon the Jews, yet are the Jews no where ſaid to be ſlain by <hi>Haman. Abraham</hi> is ſaid to have offered up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> is no where ſaid to be ſlain by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo was <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> ſacrificed, that is, interpretatively or virtually,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:121497:51"/>
not actually. But how often do we reade in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that Chriſt was actually crucified and put to death by the Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. &amp; 4.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. By this reaſon it may be ſaid, that the Jews only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to offer violence unto Chriſt, and put him to ſmart, but did not actually and really, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could do neither without the permiſſion of the Divine nature, nor did either without both his Mediatorly permiſſion and conſent. The Jews accounting of Chriſt as of a Malefactor or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, was that the Scripture might be fullfilled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.28. and was juſt in reſpect of God, though unjuſt in reſpect of them.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in Gods account ſuffered not only as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, but alſo as a malefactor or tranſgreſſor, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſinner imputatively in reſpect of the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin; he was ſuch a Mediator to whom it was eſſentiall (for the time) to be a Malefactor, that is, to ſuffer the guilt and puniſhment of ſin. The Prieſthood was eſſentiall to the Mediatour. To be a ſacrifice for ſin was eſſentiall to the Prieſthood, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. Therefore to be a ſacrifice for ſinne was eſſentiall to the office of a Mediatour.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt was by office, ſo he died. Chriſt died not only as a Mediatour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. but alſo as a ſurety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. He ſhall bear their iniquity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11.<note place="margin">Bajulabit.</note> as a Porter bears a burthen, and that upon the Tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He was made ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. Chriſt ſeparated his ſoul from his body, as a ſubordinate cauſe, not as a principall efficient, that is, as a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by voluntary yeelding and offering up his life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. but not as an executioner. We reade <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. that Chriſt laid down his life, but not that he took it away by violence; the ſame word that is here uſed concerning Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, <hi>I will lay down my life for thy ſake,</hi> Joh. 13.37. and <hi>John</hi> hath concerning Chriſt and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:121497:52"/>
the Saints, becauſe he laid down his life for us, we ought alſo to lay down our lives for the brethren, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. But it was not lawfull for <hi>Peter</hi> or the Saints to take away their own lives.</p>
               <p>Though Chriſt by his abſolute power could have preſerved his life againſt all created adverſary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; none taketh it from me, namely, againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whether I will or not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. yet by his limited power, he could not, but as our ſurety he was bound to permit the courſe of phyſicall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and prevailing of the power of darkneſſe, for the fullfilling of what was written concerning him; <hi>This is your hour, and the power of darkneſſe,</hi> Luke 22.53. The Jews therefore doing that which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of ſecond cauſes, not only might, but alſo (through his voluntary and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged permiſſion) did take away his life, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour but alſo actually kill him. Yet ſuppoſe the Jews were not inſtrumentall, in the actuall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of his bodily life, it is a meer non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thence to inferre the non-imputation of ſin unto Chriſt. Briefly, as this diſtinction is a meer ſophiſme and groundleſſe, ſo the diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Jews endeavouring to put Chriſt to death, but not really putting him to death, making Chriſt to take away his own life, and conſequently to be his own Executioner, is falſe and impertinent. For which, though the Jews may owe the Authour ſome thanks, yet Chriſt Jeſus himſelf and all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtians cannot but take it very ill.</p>

                  </label> 'Tis true, that <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> as you immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before ſaid, commenting upon this Text, ſpeaks as follows. <hi>And although theſe ſentences may be well expounded after this manner, Chriſt is made a curſe,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a ſacrifice for the curſe, and ſin, that is, a ſacrifice for ſin, yet in my judgement it is better to keep the proper ſignification of the words, becauſe there is a greater force and vehemency therein, as alſo that in the concluſion he affirmeth, that Chriſt bare all our ſins by imputation, and that he bare the curſe of the Law really for us, and in respect of bearing our ſins by imputation</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt was the greateſt thief, blaſphemer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But becauſe you ſo alledge him, as if he were not ſo much againſt you, nor for us in this controverſie, as indeed he is, and both of them ſo clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as no man more, that the Reader may have a true taſte of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſpirit and judgement in this point, I ſhall tranſcribe what he writes ſoon after what you have cited. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore (ſaith he) hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this place with a true Apoſtolicall ſpirit; there is neither Sophiſter, nor Lawyer, nor Jew, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſt, nor any other, that ſpeaketh as he doth, for who durſt alledge this place out of <hi>Moſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree,</hi> and apply it unto Chriſt: like as <hi>Paul</hi> then applied this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence unto Chriſt, even ſo may we apply unto Chriſt not only the whole 27 <hi>Chapt.</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> but alſo may gather all the curſes of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and expound the ſame of Chriſt; for as Chriſt is innocent in this generall Law touching his perſon,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:121497:55"/>
ſo is he alſo in all the reſt, and as he is guilty in this generall Law, in that he is made a curſe for us, and is hanged upon the Croſſe, as a wicked man, a blaſpemer, a murderer, and a Traitor, even ſo is he alſo guilty in all others; for all the curſes of the Law are heaped together and laid upon him, and therefore he did bear and ſuffer them in his own body for us, he was therefore not only accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but alſo was made a curſe for us. This is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Scriptures truly, and like an Apoſtle. Thus <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is not the leaſt appearance that I can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve why <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould ſeem, from what he writes on this Text, to doubt of his Expoſition, but very abundantly much to the contrary.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Luther</hi> and others, who conclude from this Text Chriſt to have ſuffered the wrath of God, have the true meaning thereof, will appear by proving that the perſon hanged upon a tree and accurſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. was a type of Chriſt; for if the Type bare the Ceremoniall, 'tis then manifeſt, that the Antitype bare the morall, that is, the eternall curſe.</p>
               <p>If not only the malediction of every one that is hanged upon a tree be held forth, but alſo Chriſts redemption of us from the curſe of the Law by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us be both held forth and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. then the Text <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. hath not only a proper but a typicall ſignification.</p>
               <p>The malediction of every one that hangs upon a tree is contained in the Text properly. Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of us from the curſe of the Law by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us, is another thing, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contained therein properly, but only typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. Who, without the peculiar inſpiration of the Spirit could have found that truth in that Text?</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:121497:56"/>
               <p>But not only the malediction of every one that is hanged upon a Tree is held forth, but alſo Chriſts redemption of us from the curſe of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us is both held forth and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23.</p>
               <p>The Minor is the Apoſtles, as appeareth by the cauſall particle, <hi>For,</hi> who proveth the fore-going part of the Text (which is his anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection raiſed, as we ſaw before out of <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. namely, Chriſt hath redeemed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part, for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth upon a tree.</hi> If thoſe words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth upon a tree,</hi> and that Text <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. have both but one and that the ſame one ſenſe, what then hinders that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going part of the verſe, namely, redemption of us from the curſe of the Law by being made a curſe for us, is true of every one that was hanged upon a tree in <hi>Judea</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> time until the paſſion of Chriſt incluſively, the latter words containing in them a proof of the former, as we ſaw juſt now from the cauſative particle, <hi>For.</hi> Then which infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence what is more abominable?</p>
               <p>The typicall reaſon excepted, namely, of ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt bearing the morall curſe upon the tree, there can be no ſufficient nor probable reaſon given, why hanging upon a tree ſhould infame and faſten upon the perſon hanged this ſpeciall curſe, whence followed the defiling of the Land, in caſe the body continued unburied after Sun-ſet, above all other capitall ſufferings. For were all received which is ſaid by the Hebrew Doctors, that is not repugnant unto Scripture, yet it is certain that ſome crimes for which they were hanged, were not ſo great as ſome crimes which were puniſhed according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capitall ſentences without hanging. As alſo that hanging after the manner of the Jews, was not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:121497:56"/>
ſo painfull as ſome other deaths in uſe with them. Adde hereunto, which is alſo acknowledged by you, that the Jews manner was often to hang them not alive, but after they were dead, yet not he that is ſtoned alive to death is accurſed, but he that is hanged (though firſt ſtoned to death) is accurſed; hanging after ſtoning, though it be acknowledged, yet it is not ſo clearly expreſſed in Scripture, as burning after ſtoning is, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.25. burning the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſhes, was as ſore an execution in it ſelf, as hanging up the body for a ſhort ſpace.</p>
               <p>There were Malefactors hanged before the giving of this Law, <hi>Deu.</hi> 21.23. yet we reade not that they were accurſed, during the ſpace between the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this Law and the Paſſion of Chriſt, a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor hanged out of <hi>Judea</hi> was not accurſed. In <hi>Iudea</hi> no perſon how great a malefector ſoever if not hanged was thus accurſed: The perſon hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was equally accurſed, whether he was hanged alive or dead, whether he was hanged after this manner or after that, Jewiſh or Romane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his crime were more hainous, or not ſo hainous. yea, for ought appeareth, though he were innocent, yet if hanged judicially he was accurſed. Since the Paſſion of Chriſt, hanging in <hi>Iudea,</hi> is not ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially accurſed.</p>
               <p>For otherwiſe (ſaith <hi>Iunius</hi>) neither according to the Law of nature, nor according to civill Law,<note place="margin">Nam alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui neque ſecundum naturae le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, <hi>&amp;c. Junius</hi> paral. lib. <hi>2.</hi> par. <hi>52.</hi>
                  </note> nor in reſpect of the thing it ſelf, is he that is hanged, accurſed; ſeeing therefore the cauſe why the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe of him that is hanged, muſt not continue all night unburied, is ceremoniall; Chriſt being the body, and fullfilling of the ceremonies, it is no doubt but in this ceremoniall curſe (<hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being a Type of our eternall Mediatour) had reſpect unto our eternall and perfect mediation. This Expoſition making the man that was hanged
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:121497:57"/>
upon a tree, a ceremoniall curſe, and Chriſt hanged upon a tree a morall curſe, is both generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and every way agreeing to the analogy of faith, which is a rule of interpreting Scripture.</p>
               <p>In that Chriſt <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. is expreſly ſaid to be a curſe, it will thence unavoidably follow, that ſinne was ſome way judicially upon Chriſt; for we reade of no curſe inflicted according to the determinate and revealed way of proceeding with the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, but preſuppoſeth ſin. Wherefore he could neither have been made a curſe, nor die, ſince the only cauſe of the curſe and of death is ſin, from the which he was free,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</note> but becauſe he had taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our ſins. So <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſition then, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth upon a tree,</hi> is a typicall propoſition, and containeth in it theſe two truths. 1. That every one that hangeth upon a tree in <hi>Iudea</hi> from the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that curſe untill the Paſſion of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, is ceremonially accurſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that are hanged ſhall be infamed with this ſpeciall infamy, that the carcaſſes of ſuch, in caſe they be not buried before Sun-ſet ſhall defile the Land. 2. That Chriſt in teſtimony that he redeemed us by beating the morall curſe ſhould be hanged upon a tree.</p>

The kinde of ſins that are ſaid to deſerve this curſe of hanging upon a tree, are deſcribed by this generall term, a ſinne worthy of death, namely of this death; hence it is evident, that not every ſinne that deſerved death is here meant, but ſuch as deſerved a double death, namely,</hi> 1. <hi>Stoning to death.</hi> 2. <hi>Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of their bodies upon a tree, after they were ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death.</hi>

               <p>Pain of loſſe and Pain of ſenſe make up the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell. Pain of loſſe then being but a part of the curſe or puniſhment, the part is to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the whole, as the puniſhment is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either eſſentially for ſuch executions of juſtice as flow from the curſe, as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> the not enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ought of the good of the promiſes, and the ſuffering of all the ſubſtantiall poſitive evill of the curſe, without any reſpect unto the condition of the Patient, or accidentally for ſuch executions of juſtice as are inſeparable concomitants of the ſtate of the damned, yet flow not from the ſimple nature of the curſe, but in reſpect of the condition of the patient, <hi>viz.</hi> total and final ſeparation from God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which oft above.</p>
               <p>The Favour of God is taken largely for the effects of his common bounty; ſo the wicked are for their ſin ſeparated from the favour of God; or it is taken properly for the ſpeciall love of God, namely Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſo the wicked cannot be ſaid to be ſeparated from him: the Legall diſcovenanting of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate for their ſin which they have committed, is the effect of juſtice; that being diſcovenanted they fall into the bottomleſſe pit, is alſo an effect of juſtice; but totality and finality of their disunion with God without recovery by the covenant of grace, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of Reprobation.</p>
               <p>This premiſed, the errour of the deſcription is manifeſt, which holds only concerning the pain of loſſe, as it is an accidentall part of puniſhment, and belongs to the Reprobate, but not as it is of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of puniſhment, in which ſenſe it is only true of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Firſt, It is untrue, becauſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. It affirmeth a privation of Gods favour, where Gods favour never was, which is as if we ſhould in Logick ſuppoſe a privation where never was an habit.</p>

                  </note> the torments of hell are an effect and execution of juſtice, whereof God is the Authour; ſinfull qualities are a defect not an effect; therefore have a deficient not an efficient cauſe, therefore of them God cannot be the Authour: to to ſay the contrary, were to ſay, God is the Authour of ſin, which is high blaſphemy: Sinfull qualities are of the circumſtantiall not of the ſubſtantiall part of puniſhment, which is manifeſt. 1.

                  <p>But how doth this either prove the bearing of the curſe really to be no part of the obedience of the Mediator, which the argumentation intends (though the obedience whereof the Text ſpeaketh intends the contrary) or inform the Reader what the Dialogue means by its new Mediatorly obedience, which the order of diſputation here called for.</p>

                  <p>Touching the Dialogues Mediatorly obedience here are divers things which the Reader is deſired to take diſtinct and ſeaſonable notice of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the diſtinction; Mediatorly and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal obedience are not two kindes of obedience in Chriſt, but one and the ſame obedience, called Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorly from the office of the perſon obeying, Legall from the Rule which was obeyed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Concerning the nature of Mediatorly obedience, we have Firſt a new Law given, which is called the Law of the Mediatour excluding from it wholly the Law of works; Secondly, we have a new Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience conformable to that new Law, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding expreſly the eſſential obedience of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, which conſiſts in obedience to the Law of works.</p>
                  <p>That obedience which the Creditor according to the Law demands and the Debtor owes, that the Surety is to pay; but the obedience unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Law of works, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and ſuffering of the puniſhment due to ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. is that which God according to Law demands, and the Debtor namely the ſinner oweth; therefore obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the Law of works is that which the Surety ought to pay.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:121497:79"/>
                  <p>It is a fiction not only unwarrantable, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time (as I beleeve) unheard from any Claſſical authour, but above meaſure preſumptuous, expreſly to deny, about or neer 30 years of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt to be Mediatorly obedience, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on point to acknowledge only an uncertain little part of his life to be ſpent in that ſervice; it is alſo an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſnaring contradiction, to affirm that to be meritorious which is not done in a way of juſtice; Juſtice is of the form of merit: Merit is a debt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order of juſtice; it is a juſt debt. Chriſts mediatorly obedience was an act of a far higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then is the fictitious obedience of the Dialogue. It is an untruth of perillous conſequence to corrupt the Faith of the Reader by aſſerting Gods high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of ſuch a Mediatorly obedience, which is not Mediatorly obedience nor will be ſo owned of God.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt in giving up his life in reſpect of the Divine nature, as conſidered in Perſonall union with the humane nature acted in way of conſent, but not as his own executioner, hath been oft ſeen.</p>

                     </label> What the Dialogue in the beginning of the ſecond part called Mediatorly obedience; annexing this note withall upon the Margent [the thing of price which Chriſt paid for our Redemption was his Mediatorly obedience] is here expreſſed by the meritorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the bloud of Chriſt, The Reader therefore is here to be deſired to keep in minde that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intended by theſe terms is the obedience of the Mediatour; that ſo the alteration of the words may not inſenſibly ſteal away his attention to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor abuſe him into a better opinion then there is cauſe of this part of the diſcourſe which vilifieth the ſufferings of Chriſt under a ſpecious pretence to magnifie the bloud of Chriſt: nor occaſion him to drink in the minde of the Dialogue concerning our Redemption by the death of Chriſt only, according to its interpretation, it being more aptly if not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlely inſinuated under theſe words <hi>[the meritorious efficacy of the bloud of Chriſt]</hi> then under the phraſe of <hi>[Mediatorly obedience]</hi> whereof the ſhedding of his bloud only was a ſmall part.</p>
                  <p>They that deſire to ſpeak properly, diſtinguiſh thus between Value, Equality, Merit, and Efficacy in the point of Mediatorly obedience: Value reſpects the ſufficient worth of it; Equality reſpects the full and adaequate ſatisfaction thereof unto Divine juſtice; Merit is that whereby the good of Redemption is due, for the ſake thereof unto the Elect, according to the order of juſtice; Efficacy intends the actual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the benefit thereof unto the Elect. But underſtanding in this place with the Dialogue, the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:121497:83"/>
Value and Worth of the Obedience of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by the meritorious efficacy of his bloud, the fallacy of this aſſertion lieth in putting that which is not the Cauſe, namely,<note place="margin">Cauſae par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiales in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to concurſu ſtant pro unâ.</note> a partial and inſufficient cauſe to produce the effect, of it ſelf alone; for the whole and compleat cauſe. The valour and preciouſneſſe of the obedience of Chriſt, though it depends princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, yet it depends not wholly upon the eminency of his perſon, but alſo upon the quality of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Gods gracious acceptation thereof, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any of theſe would render Chriſt an inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Redeemer. Had not he been ſuch a perſon, his obedience could not have been ſatisfactory, and though there were ſuch a perſon, yet without ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the Law, there can be no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>The immutable truth of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2 17. and his inviolable juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. require obedience in the Mediatour; the Law requireth obedience, both active <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. and paſſive, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. elſe there can be no life; The Dialogues frequent reiteration of the ſame objections, forceth the reiteration of the ſame anſwers.</p>

Chriſt as Mediator is God man, therefore as Prieſt he is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Parts are of the ſame nature with the whole.

Chriſt had power of right, authority, and Majeſty, and might diſpoſe of his own life, yet having received commandment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lay down his life, he put not forth his Divine power to reſcue the manhood from deadly ſufferings, but cooperating with ſubordinate inſtruments, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the concourſe of the firſt cauſe with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, gave way to the courſe of nature, and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered a violent death.</p>
                  <p>That which the Dialogue is to prove, is, that the Mediatorly obedience of Chriſt whereby we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, is by way of price only, not by way of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip and juſt ſatisfaction unto the Law: but that which it here ſaith, is, that the bloud of Chriſt was ſhed with a large and liberal quantity, that his bloud was ſhed for the atonement of mens ſouls, that the bloud that was ſhed was the bloud of him that was God, all which are true, but conclude not the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: he ſhed his bloud, moſt true: but he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhed his bloud, but ſo as the ſenſe of the wrath of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:121497:86"/>
God was mixed with it, he ſuffered both a naturall and a ſupernatural death.</p>
                  <p>Separation of the ſoul from the body is either by the firſt and univerſal efficient, ſo the Divine nature, conſidered in it ſelf, ſeparated one from the other, or by an univerſal ſubordinate efficient acting by way of conſent, ſo the Divine nature ſubſiſting in Perſonal union acted together with the humane in the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoul from his body; or elſe by the next for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe, ſo the executioners ſeparated his ſoul from his body.</p>

                     </label> I <hi>Have already ſhewed you that Chriſt dyed a twofold death: for he died both as a Malefactor and as a Mediatour at one and the ſame time; as a Malefactor he died a paſſive death, but as a Mediatour he died an active death, and the Scripture doth often speak of both theſe deaths, ſometimes iointly and ſometimes ſeverally: when the Scripture doth mention his paſſive death, then it ſaith that he was put to death, killed and ſlain. But ſecondly, the Scripture doth ſometime ſpeak iointly of his paſſive death, and of his Mediatorly death toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one ſentence, as in</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>and in</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>(which Scriptures I have opened at large in the first part,)</hi> Luke 22.19. <hi>compared with</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24. Luke 22.20. <hi>ſo</hi> Iſa. 12. <hi>with</hi> Rom. 4.25. <hi>The Scripture doth ſometime ſpeak of his Mediatorial death only as</hi> Iſa. 53.10. <hi>he gave his ſoul to be a trespaſſe-offering for our ſins, and he offered himſelf by his eternall ſpirit,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>and he laid down his own life,</hi> Joh. 10.17, 18, <hi>and he ſanctified himſelf,</hi> Joh. 17.19. <hi>therefore ſeeing the holy Scriptures do teach us to obſerve this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the death of Chriſt, it is neceſſary that all Gods people ſhould take notice of it, and engrave it in their mindes and memories.</hi>

                  <p>By it the Dialogue means, that the naturall death
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:121497:91"/>
of Chriſt (for the ſpirituall death it denieth) is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Active, actuated by the Divine nature, yea, the joint concurrence of both natures, ſo he died as a Mediatour, and this was reall: or Paſſive, wherein the Jews and Romans inflicted upon him the ſores of death, but did not put him to death though they thought they did, ſo he died as a Malefactor. This was not real, but only in the Jews account; Such is the minde of the diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Texts wherein Chriſt is ſaid to be put to death, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. killed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. teach us, that Chriſt was paſſive in his death, but make no mention of the Dialogues twofold naturall death, nor do they deny Chriſt to be active in that death wherein he was paſſive. They ſhew plainly his bloud was ſhed, and that by Jews, but not one of them affirmeth that Chriſt ſhed it himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſa,</hi> 53.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.17, 18. and 17.19. teach expreſly that Chriſt was active, and imply him to be be paſſive as concerning the ſame oblation of himſelf by his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. ſhew us that the body of Chriſt was given for us, primarily by the Father who gave his Son, and ſubordinately by Chriſt, who by voluntary conſent gave himſelf according to his Fathers will for us, as alſo that the breaking of the bread in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament is to be uſed as ſignificative of his ſufferings. What is this to the diſtinction?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. clearly intimates Chriſt to be paſſive, but denieth him not be active in one and the ſame natural death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. ſpeak not of the death of Chriſt at all.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe Texts alledged ſay that Chriſt was active, others that he was Paſſive in his death, that is, in one and the ſame death whether it be naturall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:121497:92"/>
or ſupernaturall, but not one ſaith, his death was paſſive. Divers of the Scriptures alledged hold forth manifeſtly both his naturall and ſupernaturall death; the moſt include his ſupernatural death, none deny it.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of the diſtinction is to make Chriſt the formal taker away of his own life.</p>
                  <p>The deduction from it; therefore neither Jews nor Romans put Chriſt to death: of both which before and in the anſwer immediatly following.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinctions twofold death is but one: for he died not a paſſive death as a Malefactor, according to the Dialogue, <hi>p.</hi> 97. and 100. It denyeth the death of Chriſt as Mediatour to be Paſſive, which can hardly eſcape a contradiction. It denieth Chriſt as he was Mediatour to be a Malefactor, though to be imputatively a Malefactor was eſſential for the time unto his being a Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>As in your diſtinction of Legall and Mediatoriall obedience, you underſtand the terms Legal and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial to ſignifie two kindes of obedience, which are but two appellations of the ſame obedience, ſo in this diſtinction of the active and paſſive death of Chriſt, (according alſo as you expreſſe your ſelf clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer upon the margent) you make theſe terms to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie two kindes of death which only ſignifie diverſe affections in the Perſon dying.</p>
                  <p>The terms Mediator and Malefactor are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed as the whole and the part of the ſame office.</p>
                  <p>To be a Malefactor imputatively was an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall part, for the time, of the office of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.</p>
                  <p>The terms Active and Paſſive do not denote or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh two deaths, but are to be diſtinguiſhed as adjuncts or affections of the ſame Perſon and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, as concerning one and the ſame death.</p>

                     <hi>When I ſpeak of the death of Chriſt as a Malefactor, then the Scribes and Phariſees muſt be conſidered as the wicked inſtruments thereof, yet this muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred alſo, that I do not mean that they by their torments did ſeparate his ſoul from his body, in that ſenſe they did not put him to death (himſelf only did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate his own ſoul from his body by the power of his Godhead) but they put him to death, becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the ſores of death upon his body, they did that to him which they thought ſufficient to put him to death: and men are often ſaid to do that which they indeavour to do; as in the example of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.

                     </note> yet it is not the effect of the firſt cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt as Mediatour was the voluntary cauſe freely and readily conſenting to the Fathers will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. and 9.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Chriſt was Lord of his own life, he had power of right concerning it, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 10.18. It was his own, and he had done no wrong in caſe he had not taken upon him the form of a ſervant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.7. He had power of might to have preſerved his life, no man could take it from him againſt his will, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. All which notwithſtanding, he volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:121497:93"/>
humbled himſelf, <hi>and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2.8. Thus Chriſt was active concerning his death, but not as his own executioner, and formall ſhedder of his own bloud.</p>
                  <p>The Executioners were the immediate, external, and blameable cauſe, ſo are theſe Texts to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.32. and 3.15. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                  <p>Two of your inſtances hold not, <hi>viz.</hi> Exo. 8.18. which the diligent Reader may eaſily perceive, and <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.40. where the words are better read by Learned Tranſlators, <hi>And they roſe up early in the morning that they might aſcend,</hi> &amp;c. A third, <hi>viz.</hi> Exo. 17.16. is expounded with as good reaſon againſt you. That alſo <hi>Esth.</hi> 8.7. might be troubled if not taken from you, the true meaning of places is to be attended. Your number of inſtances, if need were, I doubt not, may be made up elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the will is in diverſe places put for the deed, but not therefore in every place, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in this. So to argue were a non-conſequence proceeding from particulars to an univerſal.</p>
                  <p>Where in Scripture the will is put for the deed, there it is alſo manifeſt that though there was the will, yet there was not the deed, as in your inſtances of <hi>Abraham, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> if yet the laſt will hold as here alledged. But you cannot produce any Scripture where the will is put for the deed, when there was a ſufficient phyſical cauſe exerted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that effect, and alſo the effect followed; it were indeed an implicate, <hi>i.e.</hi> a contradiction, yet ſuch is the caſe here. 'Tis true, no torments though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves killing could kill Chriſt until he pleaſed, and 'tis alſo true, that torments killing in themſelvs could kill him when he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>If becauſe the life of Chriſt could not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:121497:93"/>
until the time appointed, nor without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it therefore followeth, that the Jews and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans did not take away his life, by the ſame reaſon it may be ſaid of the bloud that was ſhed at the ſcourging, crucifying, the piercing of his ſide with the Lance, that they did not take away that bloud from him only endeavoured to take away his bloud: for that bloud was not ſhed until the time appointed, not until Chriſt pleaſed, it being in the power of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature to have retained it. Nay, why may it not be ſaid by the ſame reaſon, of all the ſufferings inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him by men, that they did but endeavour to afflict him, but they did not afflict him, ſince all the evils that men inflicted upon him were inflicted according to his conſent, and in the time and manner as was written, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.18. This reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much favoureth <hi>Socinians</hi> and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who deny the ſufferings of Chriſt to be real, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them only to be Metaphoricall.</p>
                  <p>It is a daring aſſertion, when there is not one text, nor (I beleeve) one Claſſicall Authour who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Chriſt as the next and formall cauſe ſhed his bloud, but on the contrary, plentifull Texts and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, that he was put to death, kil'd, and ſlain, and that by the Jews, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6, 9, 12. &amp; 6.9. to contradict not only the godly whether learned or unlearned both of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and all paſt generations ſince the Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus, but alſo the Scriptures themſelves in ſaying the Jews did not actually put Chriſt to death. Nor let the Jews, Romans, or <hi>Pilate</hi> rejoyce at this; in vain doth the Dialogue diſcharge whom God hath charged.</p>
                  <p>After all this, give me leave again to minde the Reader, that though this untruth were true, yet it is impertinent to the queſtion; for what though the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:121497:94"/>
Jews did not put Chriſt to a natural death? what though Chriſt ſhed his own bloud? what though he were his own Executioner, yea, killed himſelf? which laſt though the Dialogue in words ſomewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet in conſequence aſſerts (at the writing of which my pen trembleth) doth it therefore follow that God did not inflict upon him his paenall wrath?</p>

The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his death performed by the joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both natures, is again aſcribed wholly unto the divine nature; which gave the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power to the oblation of the humane nature: for the illuſtration and confirmation whereof, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds two diſtinctions, Firſt of Legall and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriall obedience.

                  <p>THe Dialogue denying the imputation of ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, thereupon neceſſarily denieth Chriſts ſuffering of the puniſhment due for ſin (which is uſually called his paſſive obedience) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall all legall obedience performed by him in our ſtead whether paſſive or active; hereupon it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to deny all Legall Mediatorly obedience, and conſequently the legall obedience of Chriſt to be the meritorious price of our redemption, or to be the matter of our Juſtification.

                  <p>As the denial of Chriſts Legal obedience to have place in the meritorious cauſe, forced the Authour to finde out a new Mediatorly obedience, as the price of our redemption; which we have already exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſo the denial of his Legal obedience to be the matter of our juſtification, forceth him to invent a new way of juſtifying (I cannot ſay a new matter

                     </label> The Dialogues objecting againſt the Decalogues being called the morall Law is a meer imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.</p>
                  <p>It is ſufficient (ſo farre as concerns the matter in hand) unto the Juſtification of the uſe of the term moral, if it be applicable unto the Law, as given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; though it were not applicable unto it, under the notion of the Decalogue. Suppoſe it be applicable to neither; the Queſtion is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the term Moral be aptly applied unto the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: but whether Chriſts obedience unto the Law were done for our juſtification?</p>
                  <p>The Law in Scripture is called the image of God, becauſe by it written in the heart man reſembled God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27.

The Law of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. becauſe it required perſonal and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto, as the condition of our Juſtification. By Divines it is called the Decalogue becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of ten Commandements. The ſecond edition
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:121497:98"/>
of the Law of nature being firſt concreated with our nature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. and afterwards written upon two Tables of ſtones, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.18. The morall Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the perpetuall rule of manners teaching how we ſhould be ordered towards God and Man, and alſo to diſtinguiſh it from the Ceremoniall and judiciall Law: But not becauſe every one of the ten Commandments were engraven in our nature in the time of <hi>Adams</hi> innocency, as the Dialogue puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to make way for its burdening of us with its vain and impertinent objection againſt calling the Decalogue the morall Law.</p>
                  <p>Though the Decalogue or moral Law were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, yet it is not therefore called the moral Law, becauſe it was written in his heart.

                  <p>If the term Moral extend not to the Latitude of the Law in all conſiderations, the Law is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contracted unto the term; neither in it ſelf nor in the intention of the Authours thereof, who have many more names to expreſſe the Law by.</p>

                  <p>Morall duties ſo called from the Law, that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and perpetual rule of manners teaching how man ſhould be ordered, diſpoſed, qualified, conformed, and (if we may ſo ſpeak) mannered towards God and man: are co-extended with the Law it ſelf; Law and Duty are Relates: as therefore faith in Chriſt becometh a part of mans duty and orderly or regular diſpoſition and conformity towards God; what hinders but in this larger acception thereof it may be ſaid to be a morall duty? though ſtrictly (and according to the ſenſe of that uſuall diſtinction of faith and manners) it is not ſo taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adams</hi> knowing nothing concerning faith in Chriſt until after the fall, doth not diſprove a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in him wherby he was able to beleeve in Chriſt. The Angels knew no more of Chriſts being propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them to be beleeved in as their head and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmer, then <hi>Adam</hi> did of Chriſts being propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to be beleeved in as his head and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Yet the Angels in their Creation received a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple whereby they were able to beleeve in Chriſt as their head and confirmer (being commanded ſo to do) without the inſpiring of any new principle. Had Chriſt in like manner been propounded unto <hi>Adam,</hi> yet in his innocency to have been beleeved in as his Head and Confirmer, which was no more repugnant to that eſtate then to the ſtate of the Angels, he had been alſo (through proportionable concourſe of the firſt cauſe) able to have yeelded like obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; the concreated image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> and in the Angels being the ſame in kinde. Why then was not that principle in <hi>Adam</hi> able to have carried him out to have beleeved in Chriſt as a Head and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer?
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:121497:99"/>
could that command have conſiſted with the ſtate of innocency?</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> not beleeving in Chriſt in the ſtate of innocency, was not through the defect of a principle enabling him thereunto: But by reaſon, Firſt, of the inconſiſtency of juſtifying faith with that eſtate. Secondly, By reaſon of the not revealing of the object of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had a principle enabling him to parental duties, yet never was he called thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as alſo to duties of mercy and charity, which yet were inconſiſtent with that eſtate: the Saints in glory have a principle whereby they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duties of repentance, patience, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the like may be ſaid of Chriſt, though neither Chriſt nor the Saints are called thereunto; thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices inconſiſting with their eſtate. More might be added to evince this truth if that were the Queſtion, but it may ſuffice that by what is ſpoken your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the engraving of faith in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, to prove that the term <hi>Morall</hi> is unfitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ten Commandments, is of no force.

Dialogue is all this while beſides the Queſtion, for our Quere is not, Whether the ten Commandments in the full latitude of them were given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency: but whether the obedience of Chriſt to the Law (that is, to the Law as given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency) were for our Juſtification? whoſe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative by the way appeareth thus.</p>
                  <p>That obedience unto the Law whereby <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in caſe of his perſonall performance thereof had been juſtified legally, is that, by Chriſts perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof received by faith we are juſtified E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically; but the performance of obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law, as given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of obedience unto the Law, by which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in caſe of performance perſonally had been juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied legally; therefore Chriſts performance of the Law that was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever its extent be more or leſſe, as given to him after the fall) received by faith, is that whereby we are juſtified evangelically.</p>

                  <p>The fallacy of this diſtinction which is one of the fundamental errours of the Dialogue, lieth in the miſtake of an adjunct for a form, <hi>viz.</hi> in taking that which is but an inſeparable concomitant or qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience for another kinde of obedience.</p>

                  <p>The terms of Legal and Mediatorly are two names of the ſame obedience, but ſignifie not two kindes of obedience; one and the ſame obedience is called Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, in reſpect of the Law which is the rule: and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorly, in reſpect of the office of the perſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying.</p>

                  <p>That the legal obedience of Chriſt was not the obedience of Chriſt as man only, but of God-man, yea, of God man Mediator, is proved thus.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt received the Law not as man only, but as God-man Mediator.</p>

                  <p>The Law or will of God which he was to do, is that will whereby we are ſanctified, the word taken largely for our being conſecrated unto God, and therefore notes Chriſts redeeming of us.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt was made ſubject to the Law, not as man only but as God-man Mediator: <hi>But when the fulnes of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that they might receive the Adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. 4 4.5.

                  <p>If Chriſt then according to the Scripture had the Law of works or the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> written in his heart, was made ſubject thereunto, and fullfilled it not as man only but as God-man Mediatour, then Chriſts Legal obedience was not the obedience of a man only.</p>
                  <p>All the Legal actions of Chriſt God-man from his incarnation to his paſſion were the actions of Chriſt God-man Mediator.</p>
                  <p>All the Legal actions of Chriſt from his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his paſſion were the actions of Chriſt God-man, therefore all the Legal actions of Chriſt from his incarnation to his paſſion, were the actions of Chriſt God-man Mediatour.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:121497:110"/>
Such natural actions which are ſo the actions of men, as yet they are not humane, Rationall, or Morall; which conſidered in themſelves, without all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of good or evil, are indifferent; not falling within the compaſſe of a rule, are not here conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>You have been already told, that we affirm not the Legal acts of Chriſt to be Mediatorly acts, becauſe his perſon conſiſts of both natures with the reaſon thereof: But we ſay, the Legal obedience of Chriſt were the actions of the perſon, conſiſting of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; they were not the actions of a meer man: and becauſe they were performed by ſuch a perſon, in way of ſuch an office, they were all Mediatorly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

                     </label> In plainer words the meaning of the Dialogue is: The Apoſtle here by the Law underſtandeth not the Law of works, the Righteouſneſſe whereof conſiſts in Legal and Perſonal obedience: But the Law of faith, namely, the Goſpel whoſe Righteouſneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts nor in Legal obedience, either perſonal or ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but in the Fathers Atonement.</p>
                  <p>It is plain enough by the dependence of this upon the fore-going verſe, that the Law here ſpoken of is the ſame with the Law there ſpoken of, namely, the Law that was weak through the fleſh, that is, unable to juſtifie by reaſon of ſin, which all know to be the Law of works.</p>
                  <p>The way of fullfilling this Righteouſneſſe is by the Goſpel, which teacheth and giveth faith in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Bucan. loc. <hi>30.</hi> qu. <hi>28.</hi> Vide <hi>Par.</hi> Rom. <hi>10.</hi> dub. <hi>5.</hi> col. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> which conſiſts not in Atonement, as the Dialogue ſpeaks of, but in the Legal obedience of another made ours by faith, and therefore called the Righteouſneſs of faith; ſo that Righteouſneſſe or Legal obedience
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:121497:113"/>
is the matter of our Juſtification, both according to Law and Goſpel; the difference lieth in the manner of Juſtification: The Law juſtifieth by our Perſonal obedience fullfilled thereunto, the Goſpel by our Sureties obedience thereunto received by faith.</p>
                  <p>Typical Sacrifices of Atonement are called Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Righteouſneſſe, becauſe they taught and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified this truth.</p>
                  <p>The phraſe <hi>SACRIFICES of RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE</hi> ſignifieth Righteous ſacrifices, that is, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices done in Righteouſneſſe: Sacrifices (ſaith M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi>) juſt and right, and in faith, contrary to thoſe which the Prophet reproveth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. Not Sacrifices cauſing Righteouſneſs (which if ſo it were) did but further confirm that Chriſt the Antitype of the Legal Sacrifices by his obedience unto the death, purchaſed Righteouſneſſe by faith. So that hence there is neither cauſe nor occaſion to confound Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and Atonement. But let us proceed to your other Reaſons.</p>

                  <p>That Atonement or pardon of ſin only (eſpecially ſuch as denieth the Legal Obedience of Chriſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) cannot be the righteouſneſſe of a ſinner, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus.</p>
                  <p>The difference of the nature of juſtice and pardon of ſin, manifeſts that pardon of ſin only is not juſtice or righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Pardon and ſinleſſeneſſe take away deformity in reſpect of the Law, but righteouſneſſe conſiſts in a conformity unto the Law.</p>

                     </note> The judicial pronouncing of the beleever in the Court of conſcience hereupon to be juſt, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the promiſe of the Goſpel, for the merit ſake of Chriſt, this Divines call our juſtification, becauſe we are now declared to be juſt, and are judicially juſt, that is, the Beleever now made righteous by faith, is judicially diſcharged, and declared to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the condemning guilt and puniſhment of ſin, and accepted as righteous unto eternall life. The firſt is our righteouſneſſe or juſtice it ſelf. The ſecond is our being juſtified. The third is the judiciall pronunciation that we are juſtified, ſo that pardon of ſin is not a part of righteouſneſſe it ſelf, but a part of the judiciall ſentence concerning one that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and becauſe he is righteous.</p>
                  <p>To ſay pardon of ſin is righteouſneſſe is ſelf, is to confound the effect with the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Whence the reaſon is plain, why notwithſtanding both righteouſneſſe or juſtice, and the pardon of ſins be by Divines frequently made ingredients into the definition of juſtification, yet righteouſneſſe and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſins are not to be looked at as the ſame thing. Such definitions are not (nor is it by the Authour thereof ſo intended) perfect definitions adequate to thing defined, but they are deſcriptions or imperfect definitions, ſo expreſſed as beſt ſeems to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the truth unto the capacity of the reader. Again, Juſtification is an accident, now Logicians teach us ſuch definitions of accidents to be oftentimes helpful to the underſtanding that make uſe of other terms beſides thoſe which are eſſentiall. If pardon of ſin were a part of a ſinners righteouſneſſe, yet being but a part, it could not be the whole. Pardon of ſin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not compleat righteouſneſſe, becauſe righteouſneſſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:121497:115"/>
doth not only conſiſt in being ſinleſſe, but alſo in being juſt; the heavens are ſinleſſe, yet they are not juſt; the Law is not ſatisfied with negative obedience. Not only he that <hi>doth do what the Law forbiddeth ſhall die,</hi> Gen. 2.17. but <hi>he that continueth not in the things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Being ſinleſſe acquits from obnoxiouſneſſe unto hell, but being juſt giveth a right unto heaven. There is an obſervable difference between being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,<note place="margin">Injuſtus, non-inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, non-juſtus, juſtus.</note> not-unjuſt, not-juſt, juſt. The ſinner yet not a beleever is unjuſt; the unreaſonable creature is not-unjuſt. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency was more then not-unjuſt, yet was not juſt. The Beleever is juſt.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſuch pardon of ſin as the Dialogue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, namely, ſuch a pardon of ſin as doth not only diſown the Legal obedience of Chriſt imputed as its cauſe, but alſo diſclaims the very being of it. The being of the Dialogues pardon is the not being of Chriſts active and paſſive mediatorly obedience to the Law. It is ſuch a fiction as the Authour of it, and that at his concluſion undertaking to ſhew its being from the cauſes thereof, <hi>Dial.</hi> p. 133. telleth us the formal cauſe is the fathers atonement, pardon, and forgiveneſſe, but the ſubject matter is beleeving ſinners of all ſorts [the ſubject matter are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons receiving juſtification, which ſome Divines call the matter of juſtification taken paſſively, yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therewith the Legall obedience of Chriſt, which they call the matter of juſtification taken actively, namely, that which is the matter, whereby a perſon elect and called is juſtified] but if you enquire after the eſſential matter of juſtification amongſt the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes enumerated by the Authour, behold the Dialogue is ſpeechleſſe, and preſents you with a form without a matter, ſuch a being as is neither created nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſts Legal obedience was the expiation of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:121497:115"/>
ſin, that is, if Chriſt in way of obedient fulfilling the Law was a perſon accurſed, the ſacrificing of whom in way of ſatisfaction to divine juſtice was neceſſary to the taking away of ſin; Then there is no pardon of ſin without Chriſts Legal obedience ſo fulfilled and imputed.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſts Legal obedience was the expiation of ſin, which appeareth thus: The Legal offerings of atonement were typical expiations of ſin, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.36. <hi>ch.</hi> 36. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. therefore Chriſt was the reall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of ſin. He in way of obedient fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 9. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. was a perſon accurſed, and that with a paenal and eternal curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. which is already proved in the fore-going vindication of the Text. The ſacrificing of whom in way of ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, was neceſſary to the taking away of ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. where bloud is underſtood ſynechdochically, part of his ſuffering put for the whole, his bloud was ſhed together with the wrath of God, becauſe it was ſhed as the bloud of a perſon accurſed. And he went a little further, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fell on his face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> praied, ſaying, O my Father, if it be poſſible, Let this cup paſſe from me; to the ſame effect he praied the ſecond time, and the third time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39, 42, 44. If it be poſſible, If it be poſſible, If it be poſſible, hereby [the definitive way of God being ſet concerning the ſalvation of the Elect] Chriſt abundantly ſheweth, there was no other poſſible way of redemption, but by his drinking up the cup of his Fathers wrath for us, whatſoever the Dialogue ſaith to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>God doubtleſſe will not own thoſe pardons for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience unto his Law, which will not own Chriſts meritorious obedience to that Law, and that as the cauſe of pardon.

                  <p>Mediatorial obedience according to the Dialogue are certain actions performed by Chriſt not in way of obedience unto the Moral Law, but by him as God-man, and eſpecially after thirty years of age, the maſter-piece whereof was his yeelding himſelf to ſuffer a bodily death.</p>
                  <p>Atonement or pardon of ſin (according to the ſenſe of the Dialogue) is ſuch as not only denieth it ſelf to be the effect of,<note place="margin">Supra pag. <hi>105.</hi>
                     </note> but alſo denieth the very being of the ſatisfactory and meritorious obedience of Chriſt unto the moral Law. Mediatorly obedience according to the Orthodox, what? ſee.

That Atonement or pardon of ſin and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe differ in their natures, to take away unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe from a ſinner, is not to give righteouſneſſe to a ſinner, 'tis an impoſſibility for that which is not juſtice to be juſtice.</p>

                     </label> We deny that <hi>Abraham</hi> apprehended at all any ſuch Atonement, as the Dialogue teacheth, and it remaineth ſtill to be proved. I take it for granted with us, that faith doth not juſtifie us as a work; but objectively or relatively, that is, for the ſake of that which is beleeved. Though <hi>Abraham</hi> apprehended the Fathers Atonement by faith, it doth not therefore follow, that the Atonement apprehended was his righteouſneſſe. <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith apprehended A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement or pardon of ſin, not as the matter but as the effect of Righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Atonement is frequently taken for expiation, noting both the cauſe and the effect, namely, both the Legal meritorious obedience of Chriſt, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting of us from the guilt of ſin. But ſo the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue takes it not: becauſe it acknowledgeth no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential influence of the obedience of Chriſt (no not of its own Mediatorial obedience) into the being of our righteouſneſſe. Atonement according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue is the pardon of ſin, to apply therefore Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as an effectual remedy to acquit us from the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:121497:121"/>
guilt of ſin, is to make atonement its own cauſe, and its own effect, that is, to make it before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelf. The imputation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith for righteouſneſſe doth plainly argue, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was made partaker of the righteouſneſſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, or Law of works by faith without works: 1. Becauſe no man can attain eternall life without fullfilling the Law, either in himſelf, or in his ſurety: Without the righteouſneſſe of the Law there is no life, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27, 26 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. 2. Becauſe the nature of righteouſneſſe conſiſts in conformity and obedience to the Law; you may as well ſay that a man may be learned without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that he may be a man without a reaſonable ſoul, as to ſay there is a created righteouſneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conformity to the Law. 3. Becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith the righteouſneſſe of the Law, that is, the righteouſneſſe which the Law requireth, is fullfilled in us that beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. Moſt vain is the ſhift of the Dialogue endeavouring to avoid the ſtrength of this place by interpreting againſt text, context, and Scripture, thoſe words <hi>[Righteouſneſſe of the Law]</hi> onely of the righteouſneſſe typified by the Ceremoniall Law, (which it wreſts to its own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary righteouſneſſe; that is indeed no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but a <hi>non-ens,</hi> as having no eſſentiall matter, witneſſe the Dialogues enumeration of the cauſes) ſince the righteouſneſſe of the morall Law fullfilled by Chriſt was typified by the Ceremoniall Law; the righteouſneſſe of the Law is fullfilled in us, becauſe we by faith apprehend the obedience of Chriſt who fullfilled the Law for us:<note place="margin">Perkins <hi>in Gal.</hi> 3.</note> ſo M. <hi>Perkins</hi> with the reſt of the cloud of witneſſes, neither is there any other tolerable interpretation poſſible to be given; <hi>With the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 10.10. that is, unto a judiciall righteouſneſſe; upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving we are judicially declared to be righteous

A ſinner cannot be made righteous by the works of the Law, as the former verſe doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: For by the Law men come to know themſelves to be ſinners, and they that are ſinners are ever ſinners in themſelves, therefore if ever ſinners can be made righteous they muſt be made righteous by ſuch a kinde of righteouſneſſe as it pleaſeth God the Father to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them, and that can be no other righteouſneſſe then a paſſive righteouſneſſe proceeding from Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull atonement, pardon and forgiveneſſe.</hi>

The impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is the formall cauſe of our juſtification, and is the act of God the Father: The word Father not being taken perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the firſt perſon in the Trinity, but eſſentially for all the three perſons, God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; Becauſe all works wrought upon the creature are the works of the three perſons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually.</p>
                  <p>A ſinner is not juſtified by the works of the Law, namely, by works that we have done, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. For to ſuch a work four things are requiſite, <hi>viz.</hi> that it be wrought, 1. By vertue of the grace of the firſt Covenant. 2. By our own perſons. 3, With exact
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:121497:124"/>
obedience to the Law. 4. Under the promiſe of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification unto continuance therein. But yet a ſinner is juſtified by the works that Chriſt hath wrought, though not by the works that we have wrought.</p>
                  <p>If that Propoſition be abſolutely true, that they that are once ſinners are ever ſinners, then either the Saints in glory were never ſinners, or they are and ever ſhall be ſinners, and conſequently neither are nor ever ſhall be perfectly bleſſed, See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27.</p>
                  <p>Neither the juſtified perſons continuance to be a ſinner, which is the condition of all in this life, nor the dependance of juſtification upon Gods free plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor the paſſiveneſſe of the ſoul in receiving juſtification, do at all inferre atonement, much leſſe the atonement of the Dialogue to be our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                  <p>If the juſtification of a ſinner conſiſteth not only in the not-imputation of ſin, but alſo in the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſſe, then both the active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience of Chriſt are requiſite to the matter of our juſtification.

                  <p>Perfect obedience to the Law is the matter of our juſtification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>

                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:121497:131"/>
                  <p>The difference between the obedience of Chriſt conſidered as an ingredient into the meritorious cauſe,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the obedience of Chriſt conſidered as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient into the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the matter of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and conſidered as the matter of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appeareth thus.</p>
                  <p>In the meritorious cauſe it is to be conſidered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the perſon, office, and merit. In the materiall cauſe it is conſidered as diſtinct from all theſe.</p>
                  <p>They are diſtinguiſhed as cauſe and effect. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the materiall cauſe is the effect of obedience conſidered in the meritorious cauſe.</p>
                  <p>They are diſtinguiſhed as the whole and the part: Chriſts obedience is but a part only of the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but the whole of the materiall cauſe.</p>
                  <p>In the meritorious cauſe it is both a Legall and an Evangelicall act. Chriſts obeying the Law is Legall, but his obeying for us is Evangelicall; in the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cauſe it is only an Evangelicall act, it is given to us freely. There it is conſidered as wrought by him for us, here as applied to us. There is as a garment made, here as a garment put on. There it may be compared to the payment of the money by the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, here to the money as paid and accounted unto the uſe of the debtor.</p>
                  <p>As it is not the commiſſion of our diſobedience, but the guilt and puniſhment that is imputed to Chriſt; ſo it is not the formall working of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or doing of the command, but the good, vertue, and efficacy thereof, that is imputed unto the Beleever: Obedience, righteouſneſſe and life, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, guilt (which is a right unto puniſhment) and puniſhment, that is, death, anſwer one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The formall cauſe of juſtification is imputation.<note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe.</note> Imputation is the actuall and effectuall applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt unto a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever.</p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:121497:132"/>
                  <p>To impute, reckon, or account, in this place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſame thing, the ſame word in Greek being indifferently tranſlated by any of theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. To impute, is to reckon that unto another which in way of righteouſneſſe (whether of debt or grace) belongs unto him. Imputation is either Legall, imputing to us that which we have done, ſo the word is uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. or Evangelicall, imputing to us that which another hath done. Thus to impute is for God in his act of juſtifying a ſinner to account the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt [which is not ours formally, nor by juſt debt] to be ours by grace, and that as verily and really ours as if it were wrought by us. And in this ſenſe the word is uſed ten times, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.22, 23, 24. The juſtification of a Beleever is either by righteouſneſſe inherent or imputed. But not by righteouſneſſe inherent. Therefore by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe imputed. The righteouſneſſe whereby man is juſtified before God is perfect. It were deſtructive to the merit of Chriſt, and to turn the Covenant of grace into a Covenant of works, to ſay we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by righteouſneſſe inherent in us.</p>
                  <p>The inſtrumentall cauſe of juſtification is faith. We are juſtified by faith correlatively, that is, we are juſtified by that which is the correlate of faith, namely, the obedience of Chriſt. The meaning is, 'tis the obedience of Chriſt, not faith it ſelf that juſtifieth, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which is apprehended, not that which doth apprehend.</p>

                  <p>The Legall obedience of Chriſt is to be conſidered formally and virtually, as conſidered formally it is an ingredient into the meritorious cauſe of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as conſidered virtually it is the materiall cauſe thereof. Of which before.</p>

            <p>VVE ſee by your Letters you have thought it meet to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs your ſelves to us (the Elders of theſe Churches) in behalf of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Pinchin</hi> and his Book, to incline us to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtruction of the Tenets held forth in it as Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and (and to ſome of note) probable; and for himſelf to move us to intercede with our Magiſtrates to deal favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with him as a Gentleman pious and well deſerving. In both which we ſhall give you a juſt account of our Proceedings.</p>
            <p>When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pinchin's Book came over to us, it was the time of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting of our Generall Court, wherein both the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Deputies of every Town in the Country, do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together to conſider and determine of the chiefeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which concern this Colony: At the ſame time a Ship in the Harbour was ready to ſet ſayl for <hi>England.</hi> Now the Court (both parts of them, the Magiſtrates and Deputies) perceiving by the Title Page that the Contents of the Book were unſound, and Derogatory, both to the Juſtice of God and the Grace of Chriſt, which being publiſhed in <hi>England</hi> might adde to the heap of many Errours and Hereſies already too much abounding, and this Book being publiſhed under the name of a <hi>New Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, might occaſion many to think, that <hi>New England</hi> alſo concurred in the allowance of ſuch Exorbitant Aberrations: They therefore judged it meet, not to ſtay till the Elders could be gathered together; but whilſt the Ship yet ſtayed, to declare their own Judgement againſt the Book, and to ſend a Copy of their Declaration to <hi>England</hi> by the Ship, then ready to depart: Had the Tenets therein ſeemed to them to be matters, either of doubtfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or of ſmall moment, we doubt not, they would either not at all have declared themſelves againſt the Book, or if they had; they would have ſtayed for ſome opportunity of previous conſultation with the Elders; but ſome of the Tenets ſeemed to them ſo directly to ſhake the Fundamentals
<pb facs="tcp:121497:145"/>
of Religion, and to wound the vitals of Chriſtianity, that they being many of them well verſed both in the Dogmaticall and Controverſall points of Divinity, thought it their duty to profeſs their Orthodox faith againſt all deſtructive Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, and dangerous Innovations vented from amongſt our ſelves; for according as they beleeve, they do alſo profeſs (as our ſelves likewiſe do) That the Obedience of Chriſt to the whole Law (which is the Law of Righteouſneſs) is the matter of our Juſtification; and the Imputation of our ſins to Chriſt (and thereupon his ſuffering the ſenſe of the wrath of God upon him for our ſin) and the Imputation of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſufferings are the formall cauſe of our Juſtification, and that they that do deny this, do now take away both theſe, both the matter and the form of our Juſtification (as this Book doth) and take away alſo our Juſtification, which is the Life of our ſouls and of our Religion, and therefore called the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of life, Rom, 5.18. As for the Notion which you conceive he declineth, of Infinite wrath, we readily conceive with you, that though Gods wrath be (as himſelf is infinite, yet no creature can hear infinite wrath) but he ſwallowed up of it; and therefore the wicked are put to ſuffer finite wrath in an infinite time; yet this ſuffering in an infinite time is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall, in regard of the finiteneſſe of the creature, but Chriſt being infinite God, as well as finite man, his manhood ſuffering, though in a finite meaſure, the ſenſe of Gods wrath both in ſoul and body, the infiniteneſſe of his Godhead (whereto his manhood was united in one perſon) made his finite ſuffering, in a finite time, to become of infinite value and efficacy, for the ſatisfaction of Gods Juſtice, and tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Redemption. (Thus much for the Book.)</p>
            <p>Now for the Author of the Book; before your Letter came to our hands the Court dealt favourably with him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your deſire: Before they knew your deſire, they appointed three of our fellow Elders and Brethren, all of them his friends and acquaintance (ſuch as himſelf choſe) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with him, and finding him yielding in ſome main point (which he expreſſed willingly under his own hand) the Court readily accepted the ſame, as a fruit of his ingenuity, and a pledge of more full ſatisfaction; withall they gave him a Book, penned (at their appointment by our Reverend Brother M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Norton</hi>) in way of Anſwer to all his grounds, which he thankfully accepted, and promiſed upon a due peruſal &amp; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof, to return further Anſwer. All which, though it pleaſed God to have done, before your Letter came to our
<pb facs="tcp:121497:146"/>
hands; yet we acquainted our Magiſtrates with the contents of your Letter, whereto they returned this Anſwer; They doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either you had not read the Book throughout, or that having ſeriouſly weighed it (as the matter required) you would find ſome Fundamentall Errours in it, meet to be duly witneſſed againſt: For our ſelves we thankfully accept of this your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love in advertiſing us of what you think behooffull; wherein though we differ, and (as we beleeve) juſtly differ from you, yet if we did not lovingly accept advertiſements from our Reverend Brethren ſometimes when there is leſs need, we might diſcourage our ſelves and other Brethren from ſending us due advertiſements when there is more need. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the God of Truth and Peace, lead you by his Spirit of Truth into all Truth; and ſupport you with a Spirit of faithfulneſs and holy zeal, to ſtand in the gap againſt the Inundation of all the Errors and Hereſies of this preſent Age; and by his Spirit of Peace, guide and bleſſe your Studies and holy Labours, to the advancement and eſtabliſhment of Peace with Truth throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So deſiring the Fellowſhip of your Prayers, we take leave and reſt,</p>
